    quote: >-
      "The souls of people, on their way to Earth-life, pass through a room full
      of lights; each takes a taper - often only a spark - to guide it in the
      dim country of this world. But some souls, by rare fortune, are detained
      longer have time to grasp a handful of tapers, which they weave into a
      torch. These are the torch-bearers of humanity - its poets, seers and
      saints, who lead and lift the race out of darkness, toward the light. They
      are the law-givers and saviors, light-bringers, way-showers and
      truth-tellers, and without them, humanity would lose its way in the dark."
