        In this deeply personal and transformative keynote, Barry Stamos shares
        the raw, unfiltered story of his journey, revealing both the breakdowns
        and breakthroughs that have shaped his path. With vulnerability and
        honesty, Barry walks you through the highs and lows of building
        companies, navigating failure, and facing the challenges that come with
        success. Through his own struggles and lessons learned, he opens the
        door for you to explore how these truths can help you create better
        companies, stronger teams, and a more meaningful life.  This talk isn’t
        just about success—it’s about embracing failure, growth, and reinvention
        as essential parts of the journey. Barry shares his story not for
        applause, but as a blueprint for others to avoid common pitfalls, learn
        from mistakes, and rise above obstacles. By exposing the personal side
        of entrepreneurship, Barry helps you see that your breakdowns are often
        the very things that lead to breakthroughs, not just for your business,
        but for you as a leader and a human being.  In this keynote, Barry
        emphasizes the importance of vulnerability, shared wisdom, and
        self-awareness in creating not only impactful businesses but also a life
        aligned with purpose and fulfillment. Through his story, you’ll discover
        how embracing both the light and dark sides of entrepreneurship can lead
        to real transformation—at work, at home, and within yourself.
