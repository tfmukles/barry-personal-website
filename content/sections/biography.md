bio: >-
  Hi, I'm Barry - 3x exited Silicon Valley entrepreneur turned conscious
  capitalist. <br /><br />

  As CEO of SUPERNOVA, I lead 150+ exited founders accelerating transformative
  companies. My 25+ year career includes consulting for 20% of the Fortune 500,
  building a $315M business at Acxiom as a global corporate innovation leader,
  and scaling my first startup to a $1.6B exit with Oracle. I also co-founded
  1heart, guiding 1,000+ leaders toward heart-centered, purpose-driven lives
  who, in turn, co-elevate a better future. <br /><br /> I empower audiences at
  conferences, corporate events, and leadership retreats to rise to the
  moment—unlocking their higher selves with superpowers to solve the pressing
  challenges of our time, thrive, and play a greater game. As the world evolves
  at hyperspeed, the demand for conscious leadership has never been greater. <br
  /><br />Let’s connect and collaborate to create an unforgettable experience
  together, sparking the mindset shift our future demands.
