title: LET'S PLAY TOGETHER   ;-)
bio: >-
  Hi, I'm Barry - 3x exited Silicon Valley entrepreneur turned conscious
  capitalist. <br /><br />

  As CEO of SUPERNOVA, I lead 150+ exited founders accelerating transformative
  companies. My 25+ year career includes consulting for 20% of the Fortune 500,
  building a $315M business at Acxiom as a global corporate innovation leader,
  and scaling my first startup to a $1.6B exit with Oracle. I also co-founded
  1heart, guiding 1,000+ leaders toward purpose-driven lives who, in turn,
  reshape, rebuild, and reimagine our future. <br /><br />At conferences,
  corporate events, and leadership retreats, I empower audiences to rise to the
  moment—unlocking their purpose and life’s work to solve the pressing
  challenges of our time, thrive, and play a greater game. <br /><br />As the
  world evolves at hyperspeed, the demand for conscious leadership has never
  been greater. Let’s connect and collaborate to create an unforgettable
  experience together, sparking the mindset shift our future demands.<br /><br
  />Choose love, - Barry Stamos
