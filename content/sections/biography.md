bio: >-
  Hi, I'm Barry - 3x exited Silicon Valley entrepreneur turned conscious
  capitalist. <br /><br />

  As CEO of SUPERNOVA, I lead 150+ exited founders backing world-changing
  companies. My 25+ year career includes consulting for 20% of the Fortune 500,
  building a $315M business at Acxiom as a global corporate innovation leader,
  and scaling my first startup to a $1.6B exit with Oracle. I also co-founded
  1heart, a human accelerator to elevate leaders lives and expand global
  consciousness to solve planetary problems ❤️. <br /><br /> I'm here to serve
  and spark the mindset shift our future demands. At conferences, corporate
  events, and leadership retreats, my talks empower audiences to rise to the
  moment—unlocking access to our higher selves and superpowers. <br /><br
  />Let’s connect and co-create an unforgettable experience together. As the
  world evolves at hyperspeed, the demand for conscious leadership has never
  been greater. It's our time to shine by solving the pressing challenges of our
  time and this is only possible when we play a greater game together.
