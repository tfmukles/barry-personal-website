title: LET'S PLAY TOGETHER   ;-)
bio: >-
  I’m Barry Stamos, a 3x exited Silicon Valley entrepreneur turned conscious
  capitalist. As the world evolves at hyperspeed, the demand for conscious
  leadership has never been greater. <br /><br />

  As CEO of SUPERNOVA, I lead 150+ exited founders accelerating transformative
  companies. My 25+ year career includes consulting for 20% of the Fortune 500,
  building a $315M business at Acxiom as a global corporate innovation leader,
  and scaling my first startup to a $1.6B exit with Oracle. I also co-founded
  1heart, guiding 1,000+ leaders toward purpose-driven lives. <br /><br />At
  conferences, corporate events, and leadership retreats, I empower audiences to
  rise to the moment—unlocking their life’s work as a platform to solve the
  pressing challenges of our time, thrive, and play a greater game for the
  impact our world urgently needs. <br /><br />Let’s create an unforgettable
  experience together, sparking the mindset shift our future demands.
