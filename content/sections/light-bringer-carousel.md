      "The souls of people, on their way to Earth-life, pass through a room full
      of lights; each takes a taper - often only a spark - to guide it in the
      dim country of this world. But some souls, by rare fortune, are detained

      saints, who lead and lift the race out of darkness, toward the light. They
      are the law-givers and saviors, the light-bringers, way-showers and
      truth-tellers, and without them, humanity would lose its way in the dark."
