      Startups are hard, very hard. Scaling and successfully exiting is even

      triumphs and setbacks. </br></br>  In this expert panel, successful

      status will share their personal and professional journeys. They will
      vulnerably reveal the breakdowns and breakthroughs that shaped their
      paths, offering a rare and honest look at the realities of building a
      startup."
