      Startups are hard, very hard. Scaling and successfully exiting is even
      more challenging. Navigating the startup world can be a rollercoaster of
      highs and lows, filled with invaluable lessons learned through both
      triumphs and setbacks. In this expert panel, successful founders who have
      bootstrapped their way to $250M in annual recurring revenue and/or secured
      $100M in venture capital funding to achieve unicorn status will share
      their personal and professional journeys. They vulnerably reveal the
      breakdowns and breakthroughs that shaped their paths, offering a rare and
      honest look at the realities of building a startup.

      In a world where machines handle more tasks and data drives decisions,
      leaders face the challenge of maintaining the essence of humanity in their
      organizations. Without a focus on these core human values, businesses risk
      losing the warmth and authenticity that foster true loyalty and
      engagement.

      This panel discussion relays that while technology reshapes the business
      landscape, our humanity and love are powerful superpowers that can set us
      apart. By leading with heart and purpose, you can harness these intrinsic
      qualities to drive success and create a more compassionate and effective
      workplace. The session will reveal how heart-led leadership can elevate
      your business, fostering deeper connections and a vibrant company culture
      that thrives amidst technological advancement.
