      breakdowns and breakthroughs that shaped their paths, offering a rare and
      honest look at the realities of building a startup.

      In a world where machines handle more tasks and data drives decisions,
      leaders face the challenge of maintaining the essence of humanity in their

      engagement.

      This panel discussion relays that while technology reshapes the business
      landscape, our humanity and love are powerful superpowers that can set us
      apart. By leading with heart and purpose, you can harness these intrinsic
      qualities to drive success and create a more compassionate and effective
      workplace. The session will reveal how heart-led leadership can elevate
      your business, fostering deeper connections and a vibrant company culture
      that thrives amidst technological advancement.
